# DEPRECATED
- Škola online made a new app, which contains most of the features I added to my app.
- For this reason, the repo is just a showcase of tools I worked with.

# Škola offline
This is so far android (IOS in progress) mobile app for students that are using system Škola online (https://www.skolaonline.cz/). App is built on top of Škola online API.

### Why?
- Notifications on new marks or homework
- Faster loading
- Plainer UI

### Built With

* React Native
* Firebase-messaging
* GraphQL
* React navigation
